If many branches touch the same parts of a module (or component), *prebase* the code to *pro*actively extract and abstract around that part of the code.

- Your code wants to merge and spread to other branches
- Help it ~mutate~ adjust to the latest develop branch quickly and efficiently
- See which part of which commit is ~infecting~ inflicting troubles and ~symptoms~ merge issues.

This is a call for preemptive code hygiene ;-)
